# KCM-Data

## Use Cases

* __User: Academic Researchers__
        * Data visualization of KCM datasets to see if there are any relationships between when a battery module is rep$        * _Component Design:_
                * Understanding datasets - what are the features? How is it organized right now?
                * Data cleaning - Transform into a usable dataframe.  How many individual modules? Identify repeats. Ti$                * Data visualization (numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, pandas) to observe relationships that may exist betwe$
* __User: King County Metro (Predictive maintenance)__
        * Reduce sunk time and cost of unscheduled maintenance by predicting module current state of health and remaini$        * Data analysis - Is there enough data to train and test a model?
        * Train a model to predict replacement of battery module for hybrid bus fleet depending on factors such as volt$        * _Component Design:_
                * Machine Learning to predict battery module end of life
